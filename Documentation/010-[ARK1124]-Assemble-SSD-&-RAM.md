**Assemble your own ADVANTECH ARK-1124 : PART 1 - add SSD **

* ensure you are wired to Ground of the ARK-1124
you have many versions of bracelets, for example an traditional green one, 

![image.png](./Images/010-Anti-static-bracelet.png)

* or a home-made one by recycling old goodies

![image.jpg](./Images/020-HomeMadeBracelet-wired.jpg)

* for example : your arm :

![image.jpg](./Images/030-put-anti-staticBracelet.jpg)

* To install SSD, unscrew 4 screws of the bottom

* You can notice a slot to extand with 4G SIM card

* Rotate the SSD on the correct position to plug the cables

* once plugged it should look like this

* from the metallic plate, remove the 4 tiny pins that will be replaced by the screws

* attach the SSD and screw the 4 screws, and put the 4 tiny pins back into the plastic bag

**Assemble & configure your own ADVANTECH ARK-1124 : PART 2 - add RAM **
* prepare the Bill of material
  
![image.jpg](./Images/110-BillOfMaterial_RAM.jpg)

* unscrew the 4 screws
/!\ DANGER 1 : Ensure your arm is still being wired to the Ground of the ARK-1124
**/!\ DANGER 2 : When removing the heater by unscrewing the 4 screws, YOU NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFULL about the CPU and the surrounding electronical componants where special heating paste and foam are present. DON'T TOUCH THEM, DONT'T REMOVE THEM. Else the fanless system will fail, and your ARK-1124 will overheat and be damaged !***
(1) small heat transmitter foam on the left of the CPU
(2) large heat transmitter foam that will go on the top of the RAM, once inserted
(3) medium heat transmitter foam on the right of the CPU. I removed carefully to take a picture of the electrical components circled in orange to show you what it underneath
(4) blue heat transmitter paste that conducts the heat of the CPU to the heater plate

* Prepare the RAM

* Again, ensure that your arm is really shilded to the Ground of the ARK-1124 because of the static sensitive nature of what we are doing.
 Then un pack the RAM

![image.jpg](./Images/140-EnsureYouAreWired.jpg)

* insert in the angle shown below. DO NOT TOUCH THE PINS (it could rust) & DO NOT TOUCH ANY COMPONENTS !!! Just the edge of the RAM.
  
![image.jpg](./Images/150-InsertAngledRAM.jpg)

* push the RAM into horizontal position to suppress the initial angle. Ensure the left and right metallic blocking systems are in place in the semi-circle cut of the RAM
  
![image.jpg](./Images/160-PutRAMhorizontaltoremoveAngle.jpg)

* Reshape the Bleu-heat conduction paste before closing the box. For that, because the blue-heat-conduction that goes on top of the CPU has been flattened, you need to carfully reshape it, to ensure optimum heat conduction

* close and screw back

* **SANITY CHECK :** 
* plug the electricity, and turn on => Green light
  
![image.jpg](./Images/180-SanityCheck-PutPowerOn.jpg)

* start the install of the OS process (below), and the SSD should be read/writing, and generated flashy red lights
